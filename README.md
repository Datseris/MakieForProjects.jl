# MakieThemeing.jl

MakieThemeing.jl has two purposes:

1. Increase productivity when creating figures for (typically academic) papers or presentations
2. Provide beautiful themes that maximize clarity.

You are more than welcomed to use this to benefit from the themes,
or the convenience functions within.
Feel free to contribute PRs adding your own themes or more convenience functions.

Besides themeing, this package also provides several convenience functions
for accelerating writing code for a "paper figure". Highlight is the `axesgrid`, `figuretitle!` and `label_axes!` functions.

for all other information, see the online docs.
