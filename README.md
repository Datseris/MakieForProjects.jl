# MakieThemeing.jl

Theming and convenience tools for plotting with Makie.jl developed to be particularly helpful in academic work, in particular for making figures for papers.
You are more than welcomed to use this to benefit from the color themes,
or the convenience functions within. Feel free to contribute PRs adding your own themes or more convenience functions.

The color themes in this repo are all composed of 6 colors.
They have been created through extensive testing, so that their colors are most distinguishable with eaceh other,
visually aesthetic and thematic, are most distinguishable across all three major classes
of color blindness, and are distingushable also in greyscale (brightness).
In our experience, all color schemes here are more distinguishable from Makie's
default color scheme, and more aesthetically pleasing as well.

Besides themeing, this package also provides several convenience functions
for accelerating writing code for a "paper figure". Highlight is the `axesgrid` function.
