Different themes can be used for different projects and one can easily switch between light and dark background themes.\n\nYou are more than welcomed to use this to benefit from the themes, or the convenience functions within. Feel free to contribute PRs adding your own themes or more convenience functions.\n\nBesides themeing, this package also provides several convenience functions for accelerating writing code for creating a figure in a (typically academic) project. Highlight is the axesgrid, figuretitle! and label_axes! functions. MakieForProjects.jl also integrates with DrWatson and overloads wsave for Makie.Figure objects.\n\nFor all other information, see the online docs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"","page":"MakieForProjects","title":"MakieForProjects","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#Themeing","page":"MakieForProjects","title":"Themeing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"MakieForProjects","title":"MakieForProjects","text":"When using MakieForProjects, a default theme is applied that changes most theme aspects, and in particular the cycling of colors, markers, and lines.
